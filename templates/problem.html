        <p>
            In real-world insurance systems, not all claims are created equal.
            While the majority of claims result in relatively small payouts,
            a small fraction of extreme losses accounts for a disproportionate
            share of total cost. These rare but severe events are what ultimately
            drive profitability, solvency, and long-term risk exposure.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my exploration of insurance loss data, it became clear that
            traditional modeling approaches—focused primarily on average outcomes—
            are poorly suited for this setting. What truly matters in practice
            is not the “typical” claim, but the worst plausible losses that occur
            in the tail of the distribution.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Claim Severity Modeling Matters</h2>

        <p>
            Claim severity estimation plays a critical role in pricing policies,
            setting loss reserves, allocating capital, and meeting regulatory
            solvency requirements. Even small systematic underestimation of
            severe claims can lead to material financial stress for insurers.
        </p>

        <p>
            From a business perspective, the cost of underpredicting a high-loss
            claim is far greater than overpredicting a small one. This inherent
            asymmetry makes the problem fundamentally different from standard
            regression tasks encountered in many machine learning applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>

        <p>
            This project is based on the
            <strong>Allstate Claims Severity dataset</strong>, originally released
            as a Kaggle competition. Each observation represents an individual
            insurance claim, described by a combination of continuous and
            high-cardinality categorical features.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although the features are anonymized, the dataset closely mirrors
            the complexity of real insurance data: high dimensionality,
            heterogeneous feature types, and a highly skewed target variable.

        <h2>Core Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Extremely skewed loss distribution with a heavy right tail</li>
            <li>Rare but high-impact claims that dominate total loss exposure</li>
            <li>High-dimensional feature space driven largely by categorical inputs</li>
            <li>Limited interpretability due to anonymized feature definitions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Quantile Regression?</h2>

        <p>
            To directly address these challenges, I adopted a
            <strong>quantile regression framework</strong>. Rather than predicting
            an average claim cost, the model estimates conditional upper-tail
            quantiles such as the 90th percentile.
        </p>

        <p>
            This approach aligns naturally with insurance decision-making.
            Quantile estimates provide explicit, risk-aware thresholds that can
            be used for stress testing, conservative pricing, and capital
            adequacy planning.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Objective</h2>

        <p>
            The objective of this project is to build a robust, well-calibrated
            quantile regression model that produces reliable upper-tail loss
            estimates on unseen claims — and to present these predictions through
            an interactive system that emphasizes interpretability and risk
            awareness.
